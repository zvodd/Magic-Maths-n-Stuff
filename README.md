# Exploration and study of Vector Maths and Procedural Graphics in p5.js 

A series of small p5.js demo exploreing vector mathematics and proceedural drawing.

### How to Run
Download the Repoistory as a zip or tar archive and extract.
Each folder contains an `index.html` that can be opened in web browser to run the demo.


### Contents
 - 1grid_draw
   - Procedurally draw a grid.
 - 1grided_line_eq1
   - Line equation and relationship with gradiant
 - 1grided_line_eq1
   - Interactive line, prints the vector of the line. 
 - 2grided_2lines
   - 2 interactive lines, rendering their normalised vectors and dot product.
 - 3draw_a_circle
   - Projects N lines from origin to N points around a radius. Looks like a "sunburst" effect, or something that resembles a cone. 
   - Without the rendering lines the end positions of the lines would be an N precision approximatation a circle.
